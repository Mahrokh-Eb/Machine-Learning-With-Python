# Machine-Learning-in-Python-Workshop
My workshop on machine learning using python language to implement different algorithms (University of Tabriz, Iran, 2017). 

## Contents
### Part 1: Using existing packages for machine learning (Week 1 to 5)
- **Week 01 and 02:** Introduction to Numpy and Matplotlib packages
- **Week 03 and 04**: Using Scikit Learn for Supervised Learning
- **Week 05**: Using Scikit Learn for Unsupervised Learning
### Part 2: Implementing our machine Learning algorithms and models (Week 5 to 10)
- **Week 06**: Linear classification
- **Week 07**: Implementing Loss functions (Softmax loss and SVM loss)
- **Week 08**: Implementing gradient descent, Backpropagation and Artifitial Neural Networks (MLP)
- **Week 09:** Advanced topics including dropout, batch normalization, weight initialization and other optimization methods(Adam, RMSProp)
- **Week 10:** Inroduction to Deep Learning and implementing a *Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)* for image classification.

## Prerequisites:
- A basic knowledge of Python programming language.
- A good understaning of Machine Learning.
